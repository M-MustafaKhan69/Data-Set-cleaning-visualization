# Data Cleaning Practice (NumPy & Pandas)

This repository contains my practice work for cleaning real-world datasets
using Python, NumPy, and Pandas.

## Current dataset
- Tour booking dataset
- Fifa 21 data set with players complete record
- Cleaned columns, fixed encoding issues, handled missing values
- Converted monetary columns to numeric format
- Netflix data set cleaned and visualized using numpy pandas and matplotlib

## Files
- `tour_booking_clean.ipynb` — data cleaning notebook
- `cleaned_tour_data.csv` — final cleaned dataset

This repository will be updated as I practice with more datasets.
